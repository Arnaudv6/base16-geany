Base16 for Geany
================

See the [Base16 repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for more information.
This theme was built with [Base16 Builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder).

## Installation

Copy the files to your `~/.config/geany/colorschemes` directory.


## Work in progress
This is completely a work in progress and the color schemes are still being
aligned. Any help would be much appreciated.
